       WINDOWS APPLICATION : CSTiffImageConverter Project Overview
=============================================================================

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Summary: 

This sample demonstrates how to convert JPEG | BMP | GIF | TIFF images. This sample also allows to create single multipage TIFF images from 
selected images.

TIFF (originally standing for Tagged Image File Format) is a flexible, 
adaptable file format for handling images and data within a single file, 
by including the header tags (size, definition, image-data arrangement, 
applied image compression) defining the image's geometry. For example, a 
TIFF file can be a container holding compressed (lossy) JPEG and (lossless) 
PackBits compressed images. A TIFF file also can include a vector-based 
clipping path (outlines, croppings, image frames).

How to:

Step 1: Build and run the sample solution in Visual Studio 2013

Step 2: Choose a target format from the dropdown list.

Step 4: Click on the "Convert to Selected Format" button to browse the images. 
(Multiselect supported.)

Step 5: Click "Ok" after selecting the images, which will initiate the 
conversion process.

Note: if the target and the source file have the format it will do nothing.
